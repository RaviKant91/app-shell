# Getting Started
  ## Installation
  ### Prerequisite
		  -Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). You will need version between 12.x.x or 16.x.x.
		  
		  -Install https://www.sonarqube.org/sonarlint/ extension is IDE used for development purpose. (Recomended to detect SonarLint errors at development time)

  ### Install app-shell
    1. Clone the app-shell repository to your local machine and open a Terminal window in its root folder.
    2. Remove "@bh-ent-tech/bh-obfuscation-adapter" dependency from /package.json
    3. Type `npm install` to install all dependencies.
    4. Type `npm run my-command` at the root folder of your local app-shell repository for creating the build and run AppShell on localhost:8000.
   
## Running Server
### Using code
Type `npm run my-command` to start your local app-shell server.  
You should now be able to see the login screen of app-shell by going to http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser.
  #### What do each Key in configuration mean
  #### **Mandatory keys:** 
  - **grantType** - Supports  `password` and `oauth2`.
  - **secure** - Should be false for local.
  - **HTTPOnly** - Should be false for local.  

 - **clientId** - It is the app id that is created in IDP.

 - **uaaClientSecret** - It is the app's secret key found in the credentials of clientID.

 - **uaaURL** - It is the load balancer URL of the Security Service.
  
 - **redirectUrl** - In Case grantType is `oauth2`, this string needs to be registered at IDP for the callback. The URL user will be redirected once auth code is generated.
 - **tenant** - It is used for specific tenancy modes.  
 - **tokenURL** - Substring part of auth service token fetch API URL.
  #### **Non Mandatory keys:** 
 - **tenantDropDown** - If set to true(Boolean), multi tenant dropdown will be visible in appshell header, default is set to false.
 - **multiInstance** - Able to run appshell in more than 1 pod. keep it true for multiple pods and false for a single pod. It enables you to use your Redis endpoint to store session variables.
  
 - **redisConfig** - redisConfig object has host, port, username, password key which is Redis endpoint URL and Redis endpoint port to add multi-instance support for App-shell in your env.

 - **displayTextId** - This key helps making the name of microapp configurable/internationlized.

 - **productName** - It is used for specifying application name.
  
  - **designTemplate** - designTemplate sets desired layout with horizontal header if empty will show default vertical header
  - **wsport** - wsport key enables web-socket to run on the user-specified port, default port is 9000 in case the key is not specified.

 - **userInfoDialogMap** - userInfoDialogMap object helps to display static pages and microapps in a dialog box
 - **fileUploadLimit** - fileUploadLimit sets the limit of the file that can be uploaded
 - **loggerMap** - loggerMap Object is used to specify the configuration of logs
 - **templateOverloading** - This object helps in show/hide of common apps in multi-layout model
 - **id** - It is used for microapp id and should be unique.

 - **name** - It is the name of the microapp.

 - **link** - It is used for linking the microapp while navigating. It will be used in nav menus inside AppShell.

 - **icon** - It is used for the microapp icon and it should be set as material-ui with reactjs.

 - **host** - You must set the microapp URL where the microapp is running.

 - **path** - It is used for default nav.

 - **default** - When set to true it is used for loading the default microapp inside AppShell.

 - **template** - It is used for loading the default page of the microapp.
- **feedbackFlag** - feedbackFlag allows to record feedback.
- **visibility** - If visibility is false, the app will not be shown in the appdrawer/navbar. 
- **thirdPartyApp** - thirdPartyApp key should be set to true for the thirdparty app.
 - **navService** - It must be set as `/nav`.
 - **trackUserActivity** - It allows users to track activity and events across the app using matomo by setting its value as `true`. By default, it is set to `false`.
 - **userActivityServer** - It is used to define hosted URL of the matomo dashboard.
 - **baseHref** - This enables appshell to run on the route specified by the user. For example, if the value of the key is set to '/shell/', appshell will run on https://{host}/shell/#/login. If the key is not present, appshell will run on https://{host}/#/login
 - **microappServices** - This array of objects contains the microapp to be integrated with the App shell application.
- **menuItems** - This array of objects will help in grouping microapps in a single tab.
- **cssClass** - "material-icons-outlined" value will show outlined icons. Default will be filled material icons.

### Docker
- To run docker via docker-compose.yaml type "npm run local" in terminal.
- The docker-compose.yml file can be modified as required by updating builds and adding/removing services.
- If any value in the env files is to be modified, it can be done from the path /app-shell/env.
- **<ins>Update favicon</ins>** 
  1. Add/Update new image in /app-shell/env and rename the image as "favicon.ico".
  2. Uncommment the below code in /app-shell/docker-compose.yaml and re-run docker (npm run update).
```javascript
    # volumes:
    #   - ./env/favicon.ico:/app-shell/client/build/favicon.ico
```

- **<ins>Update Application Logo</ins>** 
  1. Add/Update new image in /app-shell/env and rename the image as "logo.svg".
  2. Uncommment the below code in /app-shell/docker-compose.yaml and re-run docker (npm run update).
```javascript
    # volumes:
    #   - ./env/logo.svg:/app-shell/client/build/images/logo.svg
```

- **<ins>Update Login page logo</ins>** 
  1. Add/Update new image in /app-shell/env and rename the image as "login_logo.svg".
  2. Uncommment the below code in /app-shell/docker-compose.yaml and re-run docker (npm run update).
```javascript
    # volumes:
    #   - ./env/login_logo.svg:/app-shell/client/build/images/login_logo.svg
```


- **<ins>Persist data in Keycloak after docker restart</ins>**
	1. Stop containers (in VS, right-click container and click Compose Stop; in Docker Desktop click the Stop button) and re-run using "npm run local" (bootrexport.json will be updated).
	**Note**: Do not delete/remove containers in step 1.
	2. Next, delete/remove containers (in VS, right-click container and click Compose Down; in Docker Desktop click the Delete button) and re-run the docker. Your data will now be persisted.
- **<ins>Configure websocket port</ins>**
	1. The default port for websocket is 9000, however, if the port number is required to be modified, the "wsport" key enables web-socket to run on the user-specified port.
	
Note : Ensure that  "WSL 2 based engine" is enabled in docker settings.

### Running Unit Tests
  To run test case of client side go to the <strong>client</strong> folder appshell/client and run following command
  `npm run test:coverage`

  Similarly, we can get test coverage for <strong>server</strong>-side code by the running below command at appshell/server
  `npm run test-coverage`<br/>
  
  Check the results in `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` generated by mocha & chai.    
## Configuration for different use cases
  ### Run AppShell with Mock service
  We can use the below object when we don't want to go through the authentication process.<br/> Users can login using any random username and password.<br/>
  We need to add these objects in localconfig.json
  ```javascript
      "mockSecurityServiceObj": {
      "access_token": "",
      "id_token":"", 
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "scope": null,
      "refresh_token": ""
      },
      "permittedapps": [
      {
        
        "rsid": "d45dd0cc-13d5-405f-9f77-198a5d3c2ae0",
        "rsname": "userprofileapp"
      },
      {
        "rsid": "fd1a8e91-1963-4986-a6e1-015fe91b52f6",
        "rsname": "assetTree"
      },
      {
        "rsid": "fd1a8e91-1963-4986-a6e1-015fe91b52f6",
        "rsname": "eventApp",
        "scopes": [
          "view","delete"
        ]
      }, 
      {
        "rsid": "fd1a8e91-1963-4986-a6e1-015fe91b52f6",
        "rsname": "statusApp"
      }
    ]
  ```

  ### Run micro app with WebSocket enabled
 Some third-party apps have their websocket enabled which can conflict with appshell's websocket. To handle this we have a key "isWebsocketRequired" introduced which should be "true" when we add such third-party apps.<br/>

 ```javascript
 {
    "id": "dremio",
    "name": "Dremio",
    "link": "/dremio/",
    "icon": "archiverounded",
    "host": "<host_URL>",
    "path": "/dremio",
    "template": "/index.html",
    "navService": "/nav",
    "default": false,
    "thirdPartyApp": true,
    "isWebsocketRequired" : true,
    "websocketPathMap" :[
        {"webSocketServiceName": "","websocketServicePath":"/apiv2/socket"}
      ],
    "feedbackFlag": false
  }
  ```
  ### Integrate standalone microapp into App-shell
  When running locally, AppShell looks for a `microapp-services.json` file inside the server. For easy reference of developers, there is a microapp-services.json sample file at the app-shell\server location. This file can be used by the developers to configure and start a local server.  
  ```javascript
     {
                "id": "<appid>",
                "name": "<app name>",
                "link": "/<applink>/",
                "icon": "<app-icon>",
                "host": "http://<host_url>",
                "path": "/<applink>",
                "template": "/index.html",
                "navService": "/nav",
                "default": false,
                "visibility":true
            }
  ```
  Note : If microapp is built using AppBuilder, "template" key should have value  "/micro-app.html"
  ### Add a third-party application
A third-party app is an app of which we do not have source code control.<br/>
To add a third-party application "thirdPartyApp" key should be set to true.

```javascript
{
                "id": "<appid>",
                "name": "<app name>",
                "link": "/<applink>/",
                "icon": "<app-icon>",
                "host": "http://<host_url>",
                "path": "/<applink>",
                "template": "/index.html",
                "navService": "/nav",
                "default": false,
                "thirdPartyApp": true,
                "feedbackFlag": false,
                "visibility":true
              }
  ```    
## Features

  ### Context sharing
  App Shell extends its support to communicate between different apps. You can share context with one or more apps by updating the data/status of the app, with or without navigating to another app. App Shell also allows sharing context using the deep link URL.

Detailed documentation is available [here](https://bakerhughes.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseTechnology/aerionframework/Aerion%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell%2FApp%20Shell%20Context%20Sharing%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell)
  ### Ability to control Browser History
  ```
      "navigationObject": { 
        "mode": "spa", 
        "appName": "userprofileapp",
        "deletemyHistory": "true/false" 
      }
```
The "deletemyHistory" key is an optional property that takes the value true or false.
If the value is true: the history of the previous URL is deleted; clicking the back button will navigate to the page previous to the deleted URL.
If the property is missing, App Shell will consider its value as false.

Detailed documentation is available [here](https://bakerhughes.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseTechnology/aerionframework/Aerion%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell%2FApp%20Shell%20Context%20Sharing%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell)
  ### Multiapp support
  App Shell allows you to host multiple microapps on a single screen. You have full control to define the position of an app on the page and the CSS of the components.

  Detailed documentation is available [here](https://bakerhughes.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseTechnology/aerionframework/Aerion%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell%2FApp%20Shell%20Multiple%20App%20Support%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell)
  ### Display and edit user information
  App shell provides the capability to display and edit user information. The initials of the user appear in the icon located at the top-right of the screen. Keycloak users can view and edit user information. 
  ### Health probes
Health checks, or probes as they are called in Kubernetes, are carried out by the kubelet to determine when to restart a container (liveness probes) and used by services and deployments to determine if a pod should receive traffic (readiness probes).
- Liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs. 
- The kubelet uses readiness probes to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.

Update deployment yaml with the probe keys as shown in the github commit [here](https://github.com/bh-ent-tech/cde_kubernetes_deployment/commit/4b5b3a2b6891e47f375a0534f7d0d3c36bed3102).

Note: This feature is aviable from Q1 2022.


  ### Display static page and microapps in a dialog box
  Add userInfoDialogMap key in appshell-config as below to display static information such as policies, License and attributes, etc. in a web page. 
  
  Note:
  1. App object should be available in microServices array
  2. Permission should be created for the specific resource in keycloak
  
  Below example depicts how to configure object for different types(file, app, group)
  ```javascript
          "userInfoDialogMap": [
          {
            "type": "file",
            "location": "/openResourceAttributes.html",
            "name": "licensesAttributions",
            "mode": "spa",
            "icon": "tune"
          },
          {
            "type": "app",
            "location": "/user-profile/",
            "name": "User Profile",
            "mode": "tab",
            "icon": "tune"
          },
	  },
          {
            "type": "group",
            "mode": "spa",
            "name": "About",
            "icon": "tune",
            "subMenu": [
                {
                    "location": "/openResourceAttributes.html",
                    "name": "Product Licenses",
                    "icon": "tune",
                    "default":true
                },
                {
                    "location": "/version.txt",
                    "name": "Version",
                    "icon": "tune",
                    "default":false
                }
            ]
          }
        ]
  ```
  Detailed documentation is available [here](https://bakerhughes.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseTechnology/aerionframework/Aerion%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell%2FOpen%20Source%20Attributes%20In%20App%20Shell%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell)
  ### Toast Message
  App Shell provides you the ability to display toast messages for Error, Warning, Info, and Success.
  The following code snippet must be added in the microapp:
  ```javascript
//For Success Message
openSuccessNotifications(){
var event =new CustomEvent("notification",{'detail': {show: true, message: 'Application running successfully.',variant: 'success'}});
document.dispatchEvent(event);
}

//For Error Message
openErrorNotifications(){
var event =new CustomEvent("notification",{'detail': {show: true, message: 'Application error.',variant: 'error'}});
document.dispatchEvent(event);
}

//For Warning Message
openWarningNotifications(){
var event =new CustomEvent("notification",{'detail': {show: true, message: 'Application gives warning.',variant: 'warning'}});
document.dispatchEvent(event);
}

//For Info Message
openInfoNotifications(){
var event =new CustomEvent("notification",{'detail': {show: true, message: 'Application shows some info.',variant: 'info'}});
document.dispatchEvent(event);
}
  ```
  ### Logs
- Application logs example : 
    - logger.error(err3,"",vstacktrace(), req, {});
    - logger.info("RBAC response : "+JSON.stringify(response),vstacktrace());
    - logger.warn("logger configuration absent",new Error().stack);	
- Audit logs example : 
    - auditlogger.info("Authentication successful for the user",req,{"eventCategory":"login","eventType":"Authentication","eventSubtype": "Success","response":"Audit_Success"});
  ### Flexibility of choosing technologies and dependencies
  App Shell allows you to choose your front-end technologies and dependencies, independent of other microapps that may exist within a single application. All the microapps can be deployed and scaled independently.  
  ### Application Login
  Login screen to authenticate user credentials. App Shell supports the following authentication grant types:
  - Password grant -  App Shell supports OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials grant by rendering the App Shell login screen to accept login credentials, and delegates user authentication call to Security Service. This grant type supports applications with either AWS Cognito, or Keycloak, or any OAuth 2.0 implementation.
  - Authorization code grant - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant redirects login page to BH or C3 or Customer???s Okta servers. App Shell receives authorization code from the Okta servers and uses it to generate a token using Security Service. This grant type supports applications with either Okta or Active Directory or any OAuth 2.0 implementation.
  > oauth2 grantType also provides support to display License page for the first time user.
  
  > Note: make sure in keycloak authentication section, Terms and Conditions is enabled in Default Action in Required Actions. 
 
  ### Session Management
  Appshell allows two mechanism for Session Management:
  - Websocket : By default Websocket mechanism is supported by App Shell.
  - Polling(recommended) : If polling is to be used instead of Websocket, "polling":{"interval":5000} object is to be added in the App Shell config file where "5000" is in milliseconds. Interval can be configured as required.
  #### In case of external-IDP (OKTA/EIAM, etc), verify that IDP has been configured to ask for password in case of session expiry.

  ### Multi Instance Support
  You can run App Shell on multiple instances by enabling Redis cache. Redis cache allows session-sharing between two pods, resulting in improved performance and lesser downtime. To use the feature add redisConfig to config.
  ### Matomo Configurable
  Users can turn on and off the tracking of Matomo using the boolean key "trackUserActivity". By default, the tracking is off.
  ```javascript
    "userExperience": [
      {
        "trackUserActivity": false,
        "trackerType": "matomo",
        "userActivityServer": "<URL matomo server>",
        "userActivitySrc": "<URL matomo server>/matomo.js",
        "siteId": "<site id set in matomo>"
      }
    ]
  ```
  ### Update application logo
  - upload image here (https://github.com/bh-ent-tech/cde-appshell-files/tree/main/dev/icon)
  	image name should be named " logo.svg " in case of vertical layout
	image name should be named " S1.svg " in case of horizontal layout

  - run CI https://jenkinsops.prd-0000108.pause1.bakerhughes.com/job/MTC_Jobs/job/SPARQ/job/App_Shell/job/appshell-icon-image/
  - update image # in deployment.yaml and run CD
   ### Logger Configuration
  logTo property value defines if logs should be logged to "console" or to a "file"

  ```javascript
    "loggerMap":{
          "env":"development",	
          "logTo":"console",
          "threshold":"info"
          }
  ```
   ### Internationalization
  Appshell provides the capability to use the application in various languages and regions without requiring engineering changes in source code.

  Detailed documentation is available [here](https://bakerhughes.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseTechnology/aerionframework/Aerion%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell%2FInternationalization%20in%20App%20Shell%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell)    
  ### Multi layout Microapp Control Guide
  Appshell provides the ability to override the styling where you can choose to hide/display common apps for any main app when you switch between the applications. This can be achieved by adding the template overloading property.  

  Detailed documentation is available [here](https://bakerhughes.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseTechnology/aerionframework/Aerion%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell%2FApp%20Shell%20Microapp%20Control%20Guide%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell)   
  ### File Upload
  Refer to the confluence link: https://bakerhugheswiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IEGOQ/pages/17102065774/File+upload+option+in+App-Shell
  
  ### Caching Appshell Static Files
  For NGINX users: Add route in NGINX for static file caching
```javascript

	location /static/ {
		    #proxy_redirect off;
		    expires 365d; // configurable as per requirement. 365d is 1 year expiry 
		    proxy_pass http://app_shell;
		    proxy_http_version 1.1;
		    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
		}
```
  ### Run AppShell on a custom route
App Shell provides the ability to run the app on custom routes by providing a suitable value to key "baseHref" in config.yaml and updating location "/" in nginx to "/{baseHref}/".  
For example, if the value of the key is set to '/shell/', App Shell will run on https://{{host}}/shell/.  
Note: If grantType is set to "oauth2", redirectUrl should also contain baseHref value.  
```javascript
"baseHref":"/main/"
"redirectUrl": "https://{{host}}/main/authorization-code/callback"
```
Add below in nginx
```javascript

	location /static {
		    #proxy_redirect off;
		    expires 365d; // configurable as per requirement. 365d is 1 year expiry 
		    proxy_pass http://app_shell;
		    proxy_http_version 1.1;
		    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
		}
	location /images {
		    #proxy_redirect off;
		    proxy_pass http://app_shell;
		    proxy_http_version 1.1;
		    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
		}
	location /favicon.ico {
		    #proxy_redirect off;
		    proxy_pass http://app_shell;
		    proxy_http_version 1.1;
		    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		    proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
		}
	location /js {
                  #proxy_redirect off;
                  proxy_pass http://app_shell;
                  proxy_http_version 1.1;
                  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                  proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
                }
```
### Make keys Configurable
The keys ???secure??? and ???httpOnly??? are configured in config.yaml to run App Shell on both, local machine (docker) and BH environment (Cloud). To run App Shell on local, these keys must be set to ???false???. Default value is set to ???true???.

### Make favicon Configurable
Consumer can update the favicon of Appshell using below steps:
- Appshell Deployment.yaml should have below favicon mouting code (contact devops if missing)
```javascript
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
              subPath: ca-bundle.crt
              name: ca-bundle
              readOnly: false
            - mountPath: /app-shell/client/build/favicon.ico
              subPath: favicon.ico
              name: icon-files              
      imagePullSecrets:
       - name: cde-reg-credentials 
      volumes:
        - configMap:
            name: ca-bundle   
          name: ca-bundle
        - emptyDir: {}
          name: icon-files          
      initContainers:
        - args:
            - '-c'
            - |
              echo "Copying icon files..."
              cp -R /icon/* /files
          command:
            - sh
          image: ghcr.io/bh-ent-tech/app-shell-icon:4
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          name: icon-provider
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /files
              name: icon-files
```
- Consumer should update Icon image in image key under initContainers in appshell deployment.yaml. Icon Image will provided by appshell. 
	
 ### Add links to an icon on the navigation bar
 ```javascript
           {
            "type": "link",
            "location": "https://www.example.com",
            "mode": "TAB",
            "tooltipText": "Help",
            "icon": "help_outlined"
          }
 ```
  ### Feedback
App Shell lets it consumers provide feedback on any page/app loaded inside the shell. On logging in, you will view the feedback icon. Using this feedback, you can provide either of the following two types of feedback:
- Specific Feedback: Specific feedback lets you take the screenshot of the screen, use the screenshot to either suggest a new feature, report a bug, or provide any other suggestion. You can specify details in the comment section.
- General Feedback: With General feedback, you can provide any feedback in the comment section.

We need to add headerMenuConfig and serviceHub objects in configmap.yaml:
```javascript
   "headerMenuConfig": [
        {
          "id": "feedback",
          "type":"popup",
          "tooltipText":"Feedback",
          "toolTipTextId":"Feedback",
          "icon": "rate_review",
          "order":"4",
          "config":{
            "serviceId":"feedback",
            "type":"feedback"
           }
        }
   ]
```
```javascript
  "serviceHub": [
          {
           "id":"feedback",
           "hostName":"https://appshell-dev.np-0000177.npause1.bakerhughes.com/appshell-service-cms",
           "ClientProxyName":"feedback-proxy"
          }
      ]
```
Detailed documentation is available [here](https://bakerhughes.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseTechnology/aerionframework/Aerion%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell%2FApp%20Shell%20%2D%20Feedback%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell)  

  ### Notification
App Shell lets it consumers view notifications for any new updates or additions to applications within App Shell. 
- On Login, you will be able to view the Notification icon configured on the header menu.
- On clicking that icon, you can see a list with latest 5 notifications.
- If you want to view any specific notification, click the required one and and it will appear in a new tab in a PDF format. You can also choose to download the PDF.
- On clicking any notification, the count of unread notifications will decrease.
- On a click of the View All button, at the bottom of Notifications popup, you will be redirected to the microApp that displays a list of all the notifications.

We need to add headerMenuConfig and serviceHub objects in configmap.yaml for enabling notification:
```javascript
  "headerMenuConfig": [
        {
        "id": "notifications",
        "type":"popup",
        "tooltipText":"Notifications",
        "toolTipTextId":"Notifications",
        "icon": "notifications_none",
        "order":"2",
        "config":{
            "serviceId":"notifications",
            "type":"notifications",
            "navigationObject": {
               "mode": "spa",
               "appName": "eventApp"
            }
          }
        }
    ]
```
```javascript
  "serviceHub": [
        {
        "id":"notificationId",
        "hostName":"http://svc-valves-notification-management.valves:80",
        "ClientProxyName":"notification-proxy"
        }
    ]
```
Detailed documentation is available [here](https://bakerhughes.sharepoint.com/sites/EnterpriseTechnology/aerionframework/Aerion%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell%2FApp%20Shell%20%2D%20Notification%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FEnterpriseTechnology%2Faerionframework%2FAerion%20Documents%2FApp%20Shell)  

 ### Obfuscation
- JavaScript code obfuscation is a series of code transformations that encrypts your exposed code and makes it extremely hard to understand and reverse-engineer.
- Programming code is often obfuscated to protect intellectual property or trade secrets, and to prevent an attacker from reverse engineering a proprietary software program.
- Encrypting some or all of a program's code is one obfuscation method.

To encrypt the code, add the following script in package.json for Client side obfuscation & Server side obfuscation:

```javascript
"scripts": {
"create-config": "node create-config.js",
"defend": "jsdefender -c jsdefender.config.json --license 283CD738ECFA4C4FBB00BC3D3C70BFC2",
"obfuscate": "jsdefender --license 283CD738ECFA4C4FBB00BC3D3C70BFC2",
"replace-obfuscated-files": "node move-obfuscated-files.js",
"create-config-server": "node create-config-server.js",
"replace-obfuscated-files-server": "node move-obfuscated-files-server.js"
}
```

### headerMenuConfig
- headerMenuConfig object is used to display icons on the header menu.
- These Icons will display according to order given in object("order":"1").
 
To display icons, add headerMenuConfig array of objects in configmap.yaml:

```javascript
 "headerMenuConfig": [
      {
          "id": "feedback",
          "type":"popup",
          "tooltipText":"Feedback",
          "toolTipTextId":"Feedback",
          "icon": "rate_review",
          "order":"2",
          "config":{
            "serviceId":"feedback",
            "type":"feedback"
           }
        },
        {
          "id": "help",
          "type":"link",
          "tooltipText":"Help",
          "toolTipTextId":"Help",
          "icon": "help_outlined",
          "order":"1",
          "config":{
            "serviceId":"help",
            "mode": "TAB",
            "location": "https://aerion-dev.cde.fullstream.ai/http-serve/help?selectedLaunguage={language}"
          }
        }
 ]
 ```
 ### Custom text without i18
  - Update language-files in https://github.com/bh-ent-tech/cde_kubernetes_deployment/tree/master/App-Shell-DEV/App-shell
  - Run https://jenkins.dsa.apps.ge.com/job/MTC_Jobs/job/CDE/job/CDE_DEV/job/Langauge-files-DockerImage/ to create a new image
  - Update https://github.com/bh-ent-tech/cde_kubernetes_deployment/blob/master/App-Shell-DEV/App-shell/deployment.yaml with a new version of lang files image
  - Deploy App shell CD job.
  
### Global Search
A search widget has been integrated on App Shell home page that helps you search any required application. The search widget then launches the microapp either by entering the app name.

To enable this feature, following object must be added in configmap.yaml:
```javascript 
"searchConfig": {
      "id": "search",
      "component": "GlobalSearch",
      "props": {
        "placeholder": "Search",
        "isDropdown": true,
        "dropdownData": ["All","Orders","Plots"],
        "defaultDropdownValue": "All",
        "inputActiveWidth": "367px",
        "inputInActiveWidth": "367px",
        "dropdownWidth": "105px"
      }, 
      "navigationObject": {
        "mode": "spa",
        "appName": "eventApp"
      }
    }
```
```javascript
"searchConfig": {
      "id": "search",
      "component": "GlobalSearch",
      "props": {
        "placeholder": "Search",
        "isSmall": true,
        "inputInActiveWidth": "280px",
        "inputActiveWidth": "336px",
        "inputActiveTextColor": "rgba(18, 18, 18, 1)",
        "inputInActiveTextColor": "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)",
        "inputActiveIconColor": "rgba(18, 18, 18, 1)",
        "inputInActiveIconColor": "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)",
        "inputActiveBgColor": "white",
        "inputInActiveBgColor": "#014D40",
        "searchIcon":"ghost"
      }, 
      "navigationObject": {
        "mode": "spa",
        "appName": "eventApp"
      }
    }
   ```
  ### Multiple microapp single Tab
  The user can group multiple microapps under a single menuItem.
  ```javascript
          "menuItems":[
            {
              "id":"cases",
              "name":"Cases",
              "icon":"speedrounded",
              "default":"eventApp"       
            }
       ],
        "microappServices": [
          {
            "id": "statusApp",
            "name": "Status",
            "link": "/status-app/",
            "icon": "archiverounded",
            "host": "https://aerion-dev.cde.fullstream.ai/appshell-sample-app",
            "path": "/status-app",
            "template": "/index.html",
            "navService": "/nav",
            "default": false,
            "visibility": false,
            "menuItemId": "cases"
          }]
  ```
  Add "menuItemId" key in microapp object of the microservices array which is map with id of menuItem objects. And also add sample of microApp object with menuItemId key.
### Custom SVG support for microApp Icons
Custom .svg icon support is available.

#### Step to be followed:
- Consumer should provide value to "iconSvg" key present in microappServices object, where value is "path d" of SVG icon.

#### SVG icon:
```javascript
<svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">

##### Note : 
- Appshell supports only single path d value.
- Icon will be of 24x24 pixel.
- SVG icon must be validated.

### BHDS 2 Drawer with Parent Child
The user can create Parent Child Left Drawer.
- Single Parent have multiple childs.

We need to add menuItems and microappServices objects in configmap.yaml:
```javascript
   "menuItems":[
          {
            "id":"demo",
            "name":"Demo",
            "icon":"speedrounded",
            "default":"statusApp"       
          }
       ],
    "microappServices": [
          {
            "id": "statusApp",
            "name": "Status",
            "link": "/status-app/",
            "icon": "archiverounded",
            "host": "https://aerion-dev.cde.fullstream.ai/appshell-sample-app",
            "path": "/status-app",
            "template": "/index.html",
            "navService": "/nav",
            "default": false,
            "visibility": false,
            "menuItemId": "demo"
          },
          {
            "id": "userManagementAdminConsole",
            "name": "User Management Admin Console",
            "link": "/usermanagement-adminconsole/",
            "icon": "archiverounded",
            "host": "https://appshell-dev.np-0000177.npause1.bakerhughes.com/event-sample-app/",
            "path": "/usermanagement-adminconsole",
            "template": "/index.html",
            "navService": "/nav",
            "default": false,
            "feedbackFlag": false,
            "visibility": false,
            "menuItemId": "demo"
          }]
```
### Hide the menuItem child menu
App Shell allows you to hide and show the menuItem children.  
- The parent app can hide and show the child app in the left drawer.
- MenuItem can hide and show the child app from the MenuItem dropdown.
- Tooltip of MenuItem represent menuItems object name eg("name":"Cases").

To achieve this, add "visibility": false/true in the microappServices object in configmap.yaml: "visibility": true - child visible. "visibility": false - child not visible.

```javascript
   "menuItems":[
          {
            "id":"cases",
            "name":"Cases",
            "icon":"speedrounded",
            "default":"eventApp"       
          }
       ],
    "microappServices": [
          {
          "id": "eventApp",
          "name": "Event",
          "link": "/event-app/",
          "icon": "archiverounded",
          "host": "https://appshell-dev.np-0000177.npause1.bakerhughes.com/event-sample-app/",
          "path": "/event-app",
          "template": "/index.html",
          "navService": "/nav",
          "default": false,
          "feedbackFlag": false,
          "visibility": true,
          "menuItemId": "cases"
        },
        {
          "id": "userprofileapp",
          "name": "User Profile",
          "link": "/user-profile/",
          "icon": "dashboard",
          "cssClass":"material-icons-outlined",
          "host": "https://appshell-dev.np-0000177.npause1.bakerhughes.com/appshell-sample-app/",
          "path": "/user-profile",
          "template": "/micro-app.html",
          "navService": "/nav",
          "default": false,
          "visibility": true,
          "menuItemId": "cases"
        }]
```
### Refresh Window Token
App Shell allows you to configure the time interval, as required, to refresh the token. To do so, a property named ???refreshWindow??? is used in configmap.yaml.
The value of the refreshWindow property is the time interval (in seconds) after which the token will be refreshed.The refreshWindow value should be less than the Access Token Lifespan of Keycloak
```javascript
  refreshWindow:60
```
### Support for customer configurable Theme
1)Dark/Light theme can be configured through the userInfoDialogMap of config.yaml. If the user is not providing this theme config in configmap.yaml then by default it will take light theme.
```javascript
userInfoDialogMap :[{
      "type": "group",
      "mode": "spa",
      "name": "Theme",
      "id":"theme",  //Should be same id and value for theme implementations 
      "icon": "tune",
      "subMenu": [
        {
          "name": "darkTheme", //Can be i18 key or name to be displayed
          "theme": "dark", // Theme value should be match as per Bh 2.0 theme
          "default": true
        },
        {
          "name": "lightTheme", //Can be i18 key or name to be displayed
          "theme": "light", // Theme value should be match as per Bh 2.0 theme
          "default": false
        }
      ]
    }
]
```
2)Header show menu icon can be configured as part of this feature. It can be disabled through config.yaml
```javascript
  showHeaderMenuIcon:false
```
### Multi Tenancy
App Shell can connect to different Realms created per Tenant in KeyCloak.
- Add config-default.yaml which contains name of common client of the tenants
	- https://github.com/bh-ent-tech/sparq-appshell-argocd/blob/uat/config/configmap-default.yaml
- Add config-tenant.yaml which contains name of common client of the tenants
	- https://github.com/bh-ent-tech/sparq-appshell-argocd/blob/uat/config/configmap-tenant.yaml
- Update below keys in configmap.yaml
	- "multiTenancy":{"use_tms":false},
	- "tenant": "aa",
	- "uaaClientSecret":"bb"
